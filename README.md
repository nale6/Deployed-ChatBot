# ChatBot using OpenAI API

This is a project in React meant to emulate Chat GPT's functionalities in asking a question and fetching a response from generative AI.

This project utilizies the free plan of the OpenAI's RapidAPI, which has a monthly limit of 100 messages, and does not store history of messages.

RapidAPI itself is a RESTful API marketplace and serves as this project's minimal backend implementation.

Additionally, this project is text-only for the time being.

Responsive design towards mobile view is in development.

Please note that the API has a monthly limit of 100 messages for the free plan.
